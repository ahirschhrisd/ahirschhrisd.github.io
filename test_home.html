                The collection of decorative arts and design at the RISD Museum includes not only wallpaper from the
                illustrious Charles and Frances Wilson Huard Collection, but also works that demonstrate their process
                of design, including printing blocks, drawings, and oil transparencies.

                  Having multiple components of this process in a collection is unique, and it allows us to learn more
                  about the production of wallpaper, see instances of the artisans’ hands, and visualize the history and
                  life cycles of these works.
                  <br><br>
                  To preserve the Huard Collection, we have to understand how to care for the materials that the artists
                  and craftspeople used. Each material has specific requirements to preserve its structural integrity,
                  and in turn to maintain that object’s intangible cultural heritage. Overall, the best way to do this
                  is to house works in a storage environment that is clean and temperature and humidity
                  controlled.<sup>1</sup> This preventative maintenance is considered the best practice for works on
                  paper.
                  <br><br>
                  In conserving an object, our first and foremost guiding principle is that we do no harm as we mitigate
                  potential damage.<sup>2</sup> Specifically, we try to prevent the agents of deterioration. While we
                  cannot always stop the decay of materials, we can slow down the process of decomposition, which
                  happens by way of physical force (abrasions, scratches, etc), pests, pollutants, high temperature and
                  humidity levels, exposure to light, neglect, and inherent vice.<sup>3</sup> In addition to recognizing
                  these agents, we offer treatments that are reversible and compatible with the objects’
                  characteristics.

                  One of the first steps French wallpaper designers employed was the creation of design drawings.
                  Artists rendered their initial ideas in graphite. Graphite is made up of pure carbon bound by clay and
                  fired at a high temperature.<sup>4</sup> This mineral has a layered structure and is slick and light,
                  which makes it sensitive to abrasion and smudging. Artists would then sometimes add color by applying
                  opaque watercolor, watercolor, gouache, or tempera to the paper. By using color in their design
                  drawings, the artists were able to experiment with various colorways, shading, and levels of
                  opacity.<sup>5</sup>
                  <br><br>
                  As for the design drawings that utilize color, opaque watercolor, watercolor, and tempera paints are
                  each made up of different materials, contributing to their differences in opacity and textures.
                  Knowing their vulnerabilities helps us understand how long pieces containing these materials can be
                  exhibited and exposed to light without doing too much damage. Each type of paint uses pigments mixed
                  in a medium, which aids in flow and helps adhere the colors to the support, or the material on which
                  the paint sits—in this case paper.

                  To make watercolors, pigments are mixed in water and fixed to the support, often aided by gum
                  arabic.<sup>6</sup> After drying, watercolor paint can be translucent. The organic pigments in
                  watercolors
                  are very light sensitive; to preserve a work’s longevity, it is important to make sure that it is
                  either
                  framed or in a case with a UV-filtering acrylic glazing to mitigate light damage.

                  Opaque watercolor is made by mixing pigments in water and adding chalk. The addition of white to the
                  pigments increases the opacity of the colors.

                  Traditional tempera paint is made by thoroughly mixing pigments with water (or an emulsion of water
                  and oil)
                  and a binder.<sup>7</sup> Oftentimes the binder for traditional tempera paint is protein based, taking
                  the
                  form of egg yolk or milk.<sup>8</sup> Although tempera can contain oil, it dries quickly as the water
                  content
                  evaporates. This makes trying different colors and values in a drawing a relatively fast process,
                  which
                  would have been important to the design artists.<sup>9</sup> Traditional tempera paint is not without
                  its challenges
                  though; if the paint contains too much fat and oil, the colors can darken, discolor, and
                  crack.<sup>10</sup>

                  After the designer experimented and found an acceptable pattern, narrative, or scene, artisans

                  After transferring the design onto the prepared woodblock, an artist would hand carve the design by
                  following the chalk lines. Each color in a design is printed from its own block, thus each wallpaper
                  has multiple woodblocks associated with it.
                  <br><br>
                  Wood is a porous material made up of organic polymers.<sup>12</sup> Depending on the type of wood, a
                  block’s
                  physical properties may be more vulnerable to certain environments, but overall wood is susceptible to
                  damage when exposed to fluctuations in temperature and humidity.
                  <br><br>
                  To glean more information about the wood that composes the printing blocks in the Huard Collection, we
                  took samples from discrete areas that would not affect the aesthetic whole. Choosing the sample site
                  is an important consideration. The samples must be a certain size (in our case no larger than a
                  quarter of an inch) to see the structure of the grain vertically, horizontally, and radially. This
                  data can tell us the genus of wood used and with that data we can figure out the specific physical
                  properties. As of March 2024, we are still in the process of testing the wood, but we look forward to
                  gathering more information when testing is complete.

                  To create finer details, some of the wooden blocks have metal elements. Composite pieces made up of
                  different materials are especially prone to damage. Metal and wood have different physical attributes,
                  and when exposed to the same environments and deterioration threats, these materials will have
                  different responses. These differences often create more damage as the materials deteriorate due to
                  their own unique instabilities, also known as inherent vice.
                  <br><br>
                  The metal in these blocks can become damaged by fluctuations in humidity. The oxidation of the metal
                  can create corrosion—evidence to the naked eye that its structure is deteriorating. Depending on the
                  type of metal, different colors of corrosion can occur. Iron produces reddish orange rust, while
                  copper often produces a green patina but can also produce red.<sup>13</sup> Alloys, or mixtures of
                  various metals,
                  can have unique vulnerabilities.

                  Decorators and homeowners often bought a surplus of wallpaper so that in the event of a tear or other
                  damage, they could make the repairs that were needed. Because of this hands-on treatment, any repairs
                  that appear to be original are an important part of the life of a wallpaper.
                  <br><br>
                  The Huard Collection presents a broad range of condition stability and aesthetic challenges. There is
                  no “one size fits all” treatment, even for similar materials in the collection. Each wallpaper has its
                  own unique history and life that it has lived. This particular wallpaper piece, The Muses Mingled with
                  Arabesques (34.935), is undergoing treatment at Studio TKM Associates, a conservation firm located in
                  Somerville, Massachusetts. Prior to their work, we were able to do some treatment at the museum. Many
                  of the panels and fragments in the Huard Collection had, at some point in their history, been mounted
                  to an acidic craft paper, pasted onto a canvas, and stretched onto wooden supports so that they could
                  be displayed and stored vertically. We removed each panel from its frame, and many from their canvas
                  backing. The brittle and acidic paper the wallpaper was glued to likely caused structural damage to
                  the pieces. Acidity inherent within the cells makes the paper vulnerable.<sup>14</sup> Using dry polyurethane
                  sponges, we cleaned many decades of soot and dust accumulation from the face and reverse of each
                  piece. The grime we picked up with the sponges was black soot, likely from the coal-burning furnaces
                  and fireplaces commonly used earlier in the lives of these objects. We then placed the wallpapers in
                  acid-free folders with acid-free glassine paper separating each piece to protect the surfaces. The
                  folders are now housed in flat file drawers.

                  15 → Chromium was patented in 1859. Pigments of course exist before they are patented and isolated,
                  but they are often not widely available to artists until then.

                  The pigments used to color wallpapers vary widely. While the paper substrate of wallpaper is made up
                  of organic materials, including wood pulp, the pigments in the paints may not be. Pigments made from
                  inorganic materials are produced by grinding up rocks and minerals. They are not soluble in water and
                  are able to maintain their solid form and physical properties throughout the painting and printing
                  process. They are also not easily damaged when exposed to light. Using x-ray fluorescence, we can
                  learn which elements are present in various colors. This technology helps us develop conservation
                  strategies, and it can also allow us to trace production trends. Some elements were only utilized in
                  particular time periods while others, like lapis made from the lapis lazuli mineral, at one time could
                  only be mined from specific countries, in this case, Afghanistan. It can be possible to hypothesize a
                  date for a wallpaper sample based on its pigments. For example, if there is a green color in a sample,
                  and we find large amounts of chromium in our XRF data, we might know more about this sample’s date of
                  production, as this pigment was not isolated until 1838.<sup>15</sup>
                  <br><br>
                  We were able to test a number of wallpapers in the Huard Collection with generous help from the Brown
                  University Geochemistry Department. In particular, Dr. David Murray, senior research associate and
                  facility manager emeritus, and Jamie Pahigian, environmental chemical facility and lab coordinator,
                  were very helpful with both their instruments, analysis, and expertise. Using a handheld Olympus XRF
                  unit, we tested a grouping of different wallpaper fragments, borders, and sheets to find the presence
                  of inorganic elements, specifically heavy metals, including arsenic. To learn more about these
                  findings and the history of arsenic, please read <a href="https://publications.risdmuseum.org/issue-15-green/object-lesson-deceptive-decor-uncovering-arsenic-18th-19th-century-wallpapers-emily#" target="_blank">Emily Banas’s essay</a>.

                  From microscopic elements invisible to the naked eye to larger physical panels of wallpaper and all
                  the materials in between, it is our responsibility to take care of all aspects of the Huard
                  Collection. With the degradation process slowly marching on, we continually work to keep these objects
                  safe for future generations. Continuing to learn more about the materials used in these works is vital
                  to improving and evolving the ways we care for the collection.
